If you share the same feeling as mine, 2020 will be awesome in many ways.  

I officially launch this blog today and I expect it to crystalize what *really* matters. It doesn't seem like much, but I needed to find a medium that better fits my needs socially-wise.

Perhaps I will explain in later posts how I grew to <s>despise</s> leave Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and other social media, but *Souvenirs of an Electric Co.* intends to be a safer place for me to write and express myself. I expect to share ideas, projects, travels, as well as both light and heavy life momentums.

I hope readers find this content nourishing while providing them with the desire to discover and reveal the best of themselves.

Keep your lamps trimmed and burning.
