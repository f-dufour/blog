This blog is written by me, Florent Dufour. I am a graduate student in biotechnology and computational biology. 

I've been working on new technology applied to healthcare in the fields of nanotechnology, artificial organ design, and high throughput data processing. More recently, I have been tackling data privacy and self-sovereignty issues for GDPR compliant data using cloud computing and blockchain technology.

I am an avid coder and tech hacker.
